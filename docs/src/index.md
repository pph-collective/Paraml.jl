## Motivation
Paraml is a spinoff of [TITAN](https://github.com/marshall-lab/TITAN), an agent based model.  We have a number of parameters in that model, many of which are not used in a given run. Paraml addresses the following pain points we had:

* Parameters often weren't formally defined/described anywhere - some had comments, some were hopefully named idiomatically. This caused issues onboarding new people to using the model.
* Parameters were statically defined/hard coded, but we often wanted them to be dynamic.
* Parameters needed to be filled out/defined by non-technical researchers: users shouldn't need to know how to code to create a parameter file.
* Parameters need to have specific validation (e.g. a probability should be between 0 and 1, only `a` or `b` are expected values for parameter `y`). This was typically a run time failure - sometimes silent, sometimes explosive.
* If a user isn't using a feature of the model, they shouldn't have to worry about/carry around its parameters.
* Reproducibility of the run is key - must be able to re-run the model with the same params.
* We needed to be able to create common settings which described a specific world the model runs in and let users use those, but also override parameters as they needed for their run of the model.

How Paraml addresses these:
* Parameter definitions require defaults
* Can add inline descriptions of parameters
* A small type system allows validation of params, as well as flexibility to define interfaces for params
* Parameter files only need to fill in what they want different from the defaults
* Can save off the fully computed params, which can then be re-used at a later date
* Can layer different parameter files, allowing more complex defaults and re-use of common scenarios

## Getting Started

### Installation

```julia
] add Paraml
```

### Running Paraml

The entrypoint for running Paraml is `Paraml.create_params`.  This takes the parameter definitions, parameter files, and some options and returns a dictionary of the validated and computed parameters.

**Args:**
  * `def_path`: A yaml file or directory of yaml files containing the parameter definitions (see [Parameter Definition](#Parameter-Definition)).
  * `param_paths...`: The remaining args are interpreted as parameter files.  They will be merged in order (last merged value prevails).
  * `out_path`: Optional, if passed, save the computed parameters as a yaml to this location.
  * `error_on_unused`: Optional, if `True` throw an exception if there are parameters in `param_paths` that do not have a corresponding definition in the `def_path` definitions.

**Returns:**
 * A dictionary representing the parsed parameters.


**Example usage:**
```julia
using Paraml

def_path = "my/params/dir" # directory of the params definition files
base_params = "base/params.yaml" # file location of the first params
setting_param = "settings/my_setting" # directory of the second params files
intervention_params = "intervention/params" # directory of the third params files
out_path = "./params.yml" # location to save computed params to

params = create_params(
  def_path,
  base_params,
  setting_params,
  intervention_params;
  out_path,
  error_on_unused=true # if parameters are passed, but don't exist in the definition file, error
)
```


## Parameter Definition

The parameter definition language (PDL) provides expressions for defining input types, creation of types for the target application, and simple validation of input values.  The PDL itself is YAML and can be defined either in one file or a directory of yaml files. There can be multiple root keys in the parameter definition to namespace parameters by topic, and parameter definitions can be deeply nested for further organization of the params.  Only the `classes` key at the root of the definitions has special meaning (see [Using Classes](#Using-Classes)).

**An example params definition:**
```yml
# classes is a special parameter key that allows the params defined as sub-keys
# to be used in definitions for other sections
classes:
  animals:
    type: definition

**An example of parameters for the definition above**
```yml

```


Parameters are defined as key value pairs (typically nested).  There are some reserved keys that allow for definition of a parameter item, but otherwise a key in the parameter definition is interpreted as an expected key in the parameters.

The reserved keys used for defining parameters are:
* `type`
* `default`
* `description`
* `min`
* `max`
* `values`
* `fields`

Specifically, if the `default` key is present in a yaml object, then that object will be interpreted as a parameter definition.  The other keys are used in that definition

For example, in the below `type` is used as a parameter key, which is allowed (though perhaps not encouraged for readability reasons) as `default` is not a key at the same level of `type`.  The second usage of `type` is interpreted as the definition of `type` (the key) being an `int`.

```yml
a:
  type:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: the type of a
```

`classes` is also reserved as a root key (see [using classes](#Using-Classes) below)

### Required Keys

Every parameter item must have the `type`, and `default` keys (`description` highly encouraged, but not required).

See [Types](#Types) for more information on the types and how they interact with the other keys.

The `default` key should be a valid value given the rest of the definition.  The `default` key can include parameter definitions within it.  This is common with `sub-dict` param definitions.

The `description` is a free text field to provide context for the parameter item.  This can also be used to generate documentation (no automated support at this time - see [TITAN's params app](https://github.com/marshall-lab/titan-params-app) as an example).

### Types

The `type` of a parameter definition dictates which other fields are required/used when parsing the definition.

The types supported by Paraml are:
* [`int`](#int)
* [`float`](#float)
* [`boolean`](#boolean)
* [`array`](#array)
* [`enum`](#enum)
* [`any`](#any)
* [`bin`](#bin)
* [`sub-dict`](#sub-dict)
* [`definition`](#definition)
* [`keys`](#keys)

#### `int`

The value of the parameter is expected to be an integer.

Required keys:
* None

Optional keys:
* `min` - the minimum value (inclusive) this parameter can take
* `max` - the maximum value (inclusive) this parameter can take

Example definition:
```yml
fav_num:
  type: int
  default: 12
  description: a is your favorite 3-or-fewer-digit number

```

#### `float`

The value of the parameter is expected to be a floating point number

Required keys:
* None

Optional keys:
* `min` - the minimum value (inclusive) this parameter can take
* `max` - the maximum value (inclusive) this parameter can take

  type: boolean
  description: whether or not to use this feature
  default: false
```

Example usage:
```yml
use_feature: true
```

#### `array`

The value of the parameter is expected to be an array of values selected from the defined list.

Required keys:
* `values` - either a list of strings that the parameter can take, or the name of a class whose values can be used

Optional keys:
* None

```

Example usage:
```yml
locations:
  - sky
  - ocean
```

#### `enum`

The value of the parameter is expected to be a single value selected from the defined list.

Required keys:
* `values` - either a list of strings that the parameter can take, or the name of a class whose values can be used

Optional keys:
* None

Example definition:
```yml

```

#### `bin`

Binned (integer) keys with set value fields.

Required keys:
* `fields` - parameter definitions for each required field in the binned items.  Because the sub-fields of a bin are required, no default can be provided.


Optional keys:
* None

Example definition:
```yml

    prob: 0.9
    min: 11
    max: 20
```

#### `sub-dict`

Build a set of params for each key combination listed.  Requires use of `classes` root key.  The default should contain parameter definition items.  Can facet on an arbitrary number of classes.

Required keys:
* `keys` - which params under the `classes` root key should be sub-dict'ed off of

Optional keys:
* None

Example definition:
```yml
classes:
  my_classes:
    type: array
    description: which class my params has
    default:
      - a
      - b
    values:
      - a
      - b
      - c

demographics:
  type: sub-dict
  description: parameters defining characteristics of each class
  keys:
    - my_classes

```

Example usage:
```yml
demographics:
  a:
    num: 10
  b:
    num: 20
```

#### `definition`

Define an item with the given interface.

Required keys:
* `fields` - the fields defining the interface for each defined item.  Each field is a param definition item.

Optional keys:
* None

Example definition:
```yml
animals:
  type: definition
  description: Animals included in model
  fields:
    goes:
      type: any

      default: oink
    is_mammal:
      type: boolean
      description: Is this animal a mammal
      default: false
    friends_with:
      type: keys
      desciption: What animals does this animal befriend
  default:
    cat:
      goes: meow
      is_mammal: true
      friends_with:
        - cat
        - dog
    dog:
      goes: woof
      is_mammal: true
      friends_with:
        - dog
        - cat
```

Example usage:
```yml
animals:
  sheep:
    goes: bah
    is_mammal: true
    friends_with:
      - pig
      - sheep
  pig:
    is_mammal: true
  fish:
    goes: glugglug
    friends_with:
      - fish
```

#### `keys`

Within the field definitions of a `definition` type, the `keys` type acts like an `array` type, but with the values limited to the keys that are ultimately definied in the params.

Required keys:
* None

Optional keys:
* None

Example definition:
```yml
animals:
  type: definition
  description: Animals included in model
  fields:
    goes:
      type: any
      description: What noise does the animal make?
      default: oink
    is_mammal:
      type: boolean
      description: Is this animal a mammal
      default: false
    friends_with:
      type: keys
      desciption: What animals does this animal befriend
  default:
    cat:
      goes: meow
      is_mammal: true
      friends_with:
        - cat
        - dog
    dog:
      goes: woof
      is_mammal: true
      friends_with:
        - dog
        - cat
```

Example usage:
```yml
animals:
  sheep:
    goes: bah
    is_mammal: true
    friends_with:
      - pig
      - sheep
  pig:
    is_mammal: true
  fish:
    goes: glugglug
    friends_with:
      - fish
```

### Using Classes

The `classes` key as a root key of the parameter definitions takes on special meaning.  The parameters chosen in this section can be used to determine acceptable values in other sections of the params (via `enum` and `array` types), or to determine what params need to be created (via `sub-dict` type).
